# Digital_Clock
A digital clock made using Java AWT and Swing is an application that displays the current time in a digital format. The clock typically consists of a rectangular panel with digits arranged in a standard seven-segment display format, which shows the current hour, minute, and second.

The clock can be designed using the various classes and components available in the AWT and Swing libraries, such as JFrame, JPanel, JLabel, and Font. The JFrame provides the window that will contain the clock, and the JPanel provides a container for the digits. The JLabel component can be used to display the digits and Font is used to set the font size and style.
